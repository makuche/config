This folder contains so-called complex modifications
for the application Karabiner elements. When setting up the system,
copy each json file as a 'new own rule' within
Karabiner elements. This makes it possible to have a second keyboard layer.
Examples:

- Left+CMD is used as Leader key
- Leader+hjkl for navigation
- Leader+u/i/o/p/n/m for brackets [/]/{/}/(/)

To modify the layout, change the carabiner.json file and open and
close Karabiner-Elements.
