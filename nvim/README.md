### Install

> **NOTE**
> [Backup](#FAQ) your current configuration (if existing)

Neovim's configuration is located under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim` or `~/.config/nvim` on Unix machines.

Clone this configuration and move it to the right path via
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/makuche/config/ makuche_neovim_config && cd makuche_neovim_config && git sparse-checkout set nvim
```
Now move the `nvim` folder to the config folder.

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
  * Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install the kickstart
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-kickstart` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-kickstart='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    ```
    When you run Neovim using `nvim-kickstart` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. You can apply this approach to any Neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-uninstalling) information
